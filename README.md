# pyplaylist
A python program for reading and writeing to a json database for users and songs.

This was made in 2023 for my GCSE cs class activity. some stuff was modified when uploaded like comments and spelling but the code it self was in 2023.

To use install python an run py {"file location"}, it uses cli so just runing it wont do anthing it needs to be executed in terminal.
